# TalkWithYouData
TalkWithYouData is an Angular project that allows you to upload your data in .csv, excel, json, etc. formats and use OpenAI to ask questions about your data. You can perform operations like “delete rows where the name column is Null” or “get all people whose age is greater than 18”.
